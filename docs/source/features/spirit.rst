Spirit
===================================

Spirit is a mana mechanic in CryptoCraft. Books, and other items consume spirit. The spirit level is out of 100, so 100 spirit is full, and 50 is half full.

You can run the command /spirit to view your current spirit level as well as customise the display of your spirit.

If you have less than 25 spirit, vexes will start spawning to kill you. Getting your spirit back up is the only way to mitigate this problem, as dying will not reset your Spirit. Having zero spirit will also give you the Nausea effect.

How to regenerate
-------------------

Here are the methods to regenerate your spirit:

* Being near:
   * other players
   * standing dogs or cats
   * bees, frogs or turtles
   * lit campfires
   * a torchflower or pitcher plant
* Using consumable items:
   * Enchanted Golden Apple: 100 Spirit
   * EDP's Cupcake: 100 Spirit
   * Magic Sugar: 50 Spirit
   * Guzzle Juice: 25 Spirit
   * Magic Stew: 15 Spirit
* Equipping the :ref:`items<Cool Red Cap>`
* Being on level -2 of :ref:`backrooms<The Backrooms>`

.. note::
  Methods that are grouped together (ie being near dogs or cats)
  mean they don't stack (being near a dog AND a cat doesn't boost spirit any more than being near one)
