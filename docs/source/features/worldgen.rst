* Using consumable items:
   * Enchanted Golden Apple: 100 Spirit

* Being on level -2 of :doc:`The Backrooms<backrooms>`

.. note::
  Methods that are grouped together (ie being near dogs or cats)
  mean they don't stack (being near a dog AND a cat doesn't boost spirit any more than being near one)
