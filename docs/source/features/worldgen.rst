World Generation
###########

CryptoCraft features 5 datapacks that modify world generation and gameplay experiences across all 3 vanilla dimensions.

List of datapacks:

* `Dungeons and Taverns <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dungeon-and-taverns>`_ adds larger structures across all 3 dimensions, including custom trial chambers. It adds custom enchantments, however many of them are disabled in CryptoCraft.

* `Terralith <https://stardustlabs.miraheze.org/wiki/Terralith>`_ aims to enhance the Overworld by adding custom biomes and structures.

* `Incendium <https://stardustlabs.miraheze.org/wiki/Incendium>`_ aims to enhance the Nether by adding new biomes, structures, mobs and rewards.

* `Nullscape <https://stardustlabs.miraheze.org/wiki/Nullscape>`_ changes the End by adding new biomes and raising the world height.

* `Structory <https://stardustlabs.miraheze.org/wiki/Structory>`_ adds small structures to enhance the feel of the world.

Overworld
**********
The Overworld contains many new structures from multiple datapacks. Most structures only enhance visual quality and do not give good loot.

Tavern
===========

These structures are the main way to obtain maps for other Dungeons and Taverns structures in the overworld.

Trading with the cartographer villager inside once will unlock new trades that give you structure maps.

The maps offered can point to Dungeons and Taverns structures or vanilla structures.  

Trial Chambers
===========
Dungeons and Taverns add "shrines", which are trial chambers that could either be extremely small with a few rooms to being 2-3x larger than regular trial chambers.
