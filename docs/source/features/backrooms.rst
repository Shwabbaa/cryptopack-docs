The Backrooms
=======================

The Backrooms is a new modded and completely original dimension. It features unique challenging mobs to fight but also huge rewards in terms of item evolutions to upgrade your gear.

Instructions
----------------

#. This experience is reccomended after you have maxed out netherite gear and a raid farm to fill your inventory with totems of undying.

#. Craft a Portal Device using the recipe below:

   .. image:: images/portal_device_recipe.png

#. Build the portal's structure as shown.
  
   Materials required:
   
   * 4x Glowstone

   * 8x Oxidised Copper (waxed oxidised copper is okay too)

   * 4x Smooth Stone

   * Water

   * 1x Portal Device (place anywhere on the portal's rim)

#. Configure the portal device by right clicking it.

   Portal devices that have the same code will point to the same destination.

   This allows server members to explore The Backrooms seperately and not have to fight for loot, while still being able to collaborate and play with each other.

#. Jump in the water to start your adventure!

Gameplay
----------------

To prevent keepinventory PvP abuse, friendly fire is disabled in The Backrooms. Fall damage is also disabled.

The first time you die in The Backrooms, you will keep your levels and inventory. The next time you die, you will drop everything!

One way to recover your items is to use the :ref:`Invisibillity Cloak<invis-cloak>` which makes you undetectable to mobs as long as you don't have any other items in your inventory.

Evolutions
----------------

Evolutions are CryptoCraft's version of enchantments. Items may only hold a maximum of 1 evolution at a time, applying another will overwrite the existing one.

You can find evolution stones in chests around all floors of The Backrooms. Each floor has a set of unique evolutions that can spawn in the chests. 

You'll need to craft the evolution stones into evolution cores, which require evolution crystals among other items. Use the recipe book to find the recipes. Apply the evolution cores to supported items via an anvil.

A list of evolutions can be found below with each level.

Levels
----------------

There are currently 6 levels in The Backrooms. They are listed here from highest to lowest. Backrooms levels have elevator structures that can take you up and down a floor.
