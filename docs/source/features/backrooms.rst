The Backrooms
=======================

The Backrooms is a new modded and completely original dimension. It features unique challenging mobs to fight but also huge rewards in terms of item evolutions to upgrade your gear.

   Materials required:

#. Configure the portal device by right clicking it.

   Portal devices that have the same code will point to a new destination.

   This allows server members to explore The Backrooms seperately and not have to fight for loot, while still being able to collaborate and play with each other.

Gameplay
----------------

To prevent keepinventory PvP abuse, friendly fire is disabled in The Backrooms. Fall damage is also disabled.

The first time you die in The Backrooms, you will keep your levels and inventory. The next time you die, you will drop everything!

One way to recover your items is to use the :doc:`invis-cloak` which makes you undetectable to mobs as long as you don't have any other items in your inventory.
