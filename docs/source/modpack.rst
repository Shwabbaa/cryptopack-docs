Modpack
===================================

This will cover how to install the modpack

Installation
----------

.. note ::
   Download Overwolf contains literal adware, so I wouldn't get it.
   If you already have the Overwolf version, it doesn't matter but this tutorial is built for standalone.

#. Download `CurseForge Launcher <https://www.curseforge.com/download/app>`_ and Select "Download standalone"
#. Download `the modpack <https://mega.nz/file/iPQViYZL#OYmYJ9ILBkB_qFAnvYDS_sluCgXU2i2fJMy_IXMXrKU>`_
#. Install the curseforge launcher
#. Click "Minecraft" when choosing a game
#. Choose where to setup your game instances, doesn't matter where just pick somewhere
#. Click "Create Custom Profile"
#. Click the underlined "import" option at the top of the menu and select the modpack .zip you downloaded on step 2
#. Wait for stuff to download then click into the pack, then click Play
#. Click play on the vanilla launcher that should pop up
#. Once you're in game, type /resourcepack and click "Install" to install the resourcepack if it is not installed already.

That's it!

.. note ::
   The modpack contains resourcepacks that change the splash screen which are on by default. You can remove them by going to resourcepacks.
