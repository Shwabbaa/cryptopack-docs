Development
==============

Items
----------

Items can be textured just as normal.

#. Install and open BlockBench
#. Select "New Java Block/Item"
#. Create and texture your item
#. Submit the item

Bows / crossbows 
----------

* Bows and crossbows have 4 animation frames for loading the weapon

* Crossbows are actually held differently, so you will need to account for that when modelling in Blockbench (select bow in display tab)

These are how the frames are organised:

* 1 frame of unloaded item

* 2 frames drawing back / loading

* 1 frame fully charged

Submit all 4 models.

Hats
----------

The process of creating a hat is the same as creating an item like above, but make sure for the display tab you have set up and aligned the item correctly to fit the player's head.
Remember that hats block off the helmet slot without armour so you might want to consider using armour sets.

Armour Set
----------

Armour sets are applied directly above skin layers and cannot have a model, but can give armour points.

You'll have to create a texture for the each armour piece to show in the inventory, and another 2 textures for the armour model, one for each layer.
