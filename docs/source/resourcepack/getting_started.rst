Getting Started
===================================

This will cover how to install the resourcepack, and how to rename rename an item to change it's texture.

Installation (old)
----------
.. note::
  The new custom model system is 100% mod free and works on vanilla. However mods are still required for custom armour textures.

#. Install **ANY** of these

   * `Optifine <https://www.optifine.net/downloads>`_ 

   * `Lunar Client <https://www.lunarclient.com>`_ 

   * `CIT Resewn Fabric Mod <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cit-resewn>`_ 
      
      * You can install the :doc:`modpack` which contains CIT Resewn + other common mods

#. Join the server and type /resourcepack
#. Press install.

That's it!

Using commands to apply a specific model
------------
We will be creating a Meteor Client Sword.

* Find the item you want (in this case, it's the Meteor Client sword in :doc:`items`)

* In the document: ' ID: "meteor_sword", Supported Items: Swords '

* Hold a sword and type /model apply meteor_sword

Other useful commands
------------
* /model reset - resets the model you're holding to the default
* /model list - lists models you can use with the item you are currently holding
* /model listall - lists all models
* /model - to view help / usage information.

Uninstalling
------------
#. Run /resourcepack
#. Click "Uninstall"
