Blocks
***************************************

Custom block models cannot actually be made. Putting these items in an item frame and making the item frame invisible by right clicking with a wooden hoe provides the illusion of a custom block.

These models are applied using /model <ID> on matching items and do not provide functionality, they are cosmetic only.
