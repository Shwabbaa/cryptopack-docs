Blocks
===============

Due to the inability to rename blocks, custom blocks cannot be made because they would overwrite the vanilla models.

However, blocks can be reimplemented as items sticking in an invisible item frame, with the limitation of the custom block model having to be bigger than the host (actual block), otherwise the real block would clip through
