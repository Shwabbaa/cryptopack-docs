Items
===================================

This section covers held items (mostly weapons).

Universal Tools
-------------
These are **special** tools which can be applied to any tool type (swords, pickaxe, axes, shovels, hoes, and the trident)

Melee Weapons
-------------

Bows & Crossbows
-------------
Bows and crossbows are actually animated, consisting of 4 animation frames.

Totems
-------------

Other Items
-------------

Creation
-------------

Items can be textured just as normal.

Modelling items is very easy for a simple item.

#. Install and open BlockBench
#. Select "New Java Block/Item"
#. Create and texture your item
#. Submit the item

However, crossbows and Bows are different:

* They have 4 animation frames for loading the weapon

* Crossbows are actually held differently, so you will need to account for that when modelling in Blockbench (select bow in display tab)

These are how the frames are organised:
1 frame of unloaded item
2 frames drawing back / loading
1 frame fully charged
